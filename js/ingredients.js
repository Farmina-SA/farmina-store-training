const INGREDIENTS = [
  {id:'i1',icon:'🍗',name:'Fresh Boneless Chicken',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Animal Protein',
   conditions:[],
   what:'The number-one ingredient — Italian free-range chicken, used fresh (not dried) to preserve natural amino acids.',
   why:'Fresh meat provides biologically available protein that dogs and cats evolved to digest. Being listed first means it\'s the highest percentage ingredient before water weight is accounted for.',
   sell:'Ask customers: "Would you rather feed your pet fresh chicken or chicken powder?" That\'s the difference.'},

  {id:'i2',icon:'🐔',name:'Dehydrated Chicken Meat',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Concentrated Protein',
   conditions:[],
   what:'Chicken that\'s been gently dried to remove moisture, concentrating the protein content to ~4x that of fresh meat.',
   why:'Provides dense, stable protein. When fresh + dehydrated chicken are combined, the total chicken content is significant — typically 50%+ of the recipe.',
   sell:'Explain: fresh chicken is 70% water. After cooking, dehydrated meat provides more actual protein per gram.'},

  {id:'i3',icon:'🐗',name:'Italian Wild Boar',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Novel Protein',
   conditions:['allergy'],
   what:'Free-ranging wild boar from Italian forests. A novel protein rarely used in commercial pet food.',
   why:'Novel proteins are key for elimination diets. Dogs with sensitivities to chicken or beef have typically never been exposed to boar — reducing allergic responses.',
   sell:'Perfect for: "My dog keeps scratching and the vet thinks it\'s food allergies." Wild boar = untested protein = fresh immune response.'},

  {id:'i4',icon:'🐑',name:'NZ Grass-Fed Lamb',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Premium Protein',
   conditions:['allergy','skin'],
   what:'Lamb sourced from New Zealand\'s pasture-raised, hormone-free sheep. Considered one of the cleanest protein sources globally.',
   why:'Grass-fed animals have better omega-3 to omega-6 ratios than grain-fed. No growth hormones, no antibiotics — cleaner protein profile.',
   sell:'New Zealand has some of the strictest agricultural regulations in the world. Pure, traceable, premium.'},

  {id:'i5',icon:'🐠',name:'Atlantic Wild Caught Cod',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Fish Protein',
   conditions:['allergy'],
   what:'White fish caught from wild Atlantic waters. Low in fat, high in quality protein, naturally hypoallergenic.',
   why:'Cod is one of the least allergenic proteins available. Rich in B vitamins, phosphorus and selenium. The mild flavour is highly palatable even for picky eaters.',
   sell:'Best for dogs with food sensitivities or those that have reacted to both chicken AND beef.'},

  {id:'i6',icon:'🐟',name:'Wild Caught Herring',cat:'protein',catLabel:'Oily Fish / Omega Source',
   conditions:['skin','brain','heart','joint','allergy'],
   what:'Atlantic herring, wild caught and used both fresh and dehydrated. Exceptionally rich in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA & DHA).',
   why:'EPA and DHA directly reduce inflammation, support brain function, improve coat condition and support cardiovascular health. Herring is one of the richest natural sources.',
   sell:'For cats or dogs with skin issues, dull coats, joint stiffness or anxiety — herring-based food is a powerful natural intervention.'},

  {id:'i7',icon:'🎃',name:'Dried Pumpkin',cat:'botanical',catLabel:'Digestive Support',
   conditions:['digestion'],
   what:'5% dried pumpkin in the Pumpkin range. Rich in soluble and insoluble fiber, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C and E.',
   why:'Pumpkin acts as a natural digestive regulator — soluble fiber helps with diarrhoea, insoluble fiber helps with constipation. A well-known "vet trick" for GI upset.',
   sell:'If a customer mentions their dog has loose stools or irregular digestion, recommend the Pumpkin range. The 5% pumpkin inclusion makes a real functional difference.'},

  {id:'i8',icon:'🌿',name:'Inulin',cat:'prebiotic',catLabel:'Prebiotic Fiber',
   conditions:['digestion','immune'],
   what:'A natural prebiotic fibre extracted from chicory root.',
   why:'Inulin has been shown in nutrition studies to modulate gut microbiota and metabolites in both dogs and cats, supporting a healthy microbiome.',

  {id:'i9',icon:'🔬',name:'Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)',cat:'prebiotic',catLabel:'Prebiotic',
   conditions:['digestion','immune'],
   what:'Short-chain carbohydrates that act as prebiotics.',
   why:'Research in dog nutrition shows FOS supports colonic health indices and strengthens the immune status when included as part of a balanced diet.',
   sell:'Farmina uses FOS to specifically support colonic health and immune function. It\'s more than just fibre — it\'s functional gut support.'},

  {id:'i10',icon:'🧫',name:'Mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS)',cat:'prebiotic',catLabel:'Immune Prebiotic',
   conditions:['digestion','immune'],
   what:'Prebiotics derived from yeast cell walls.',
   why:'Dog nutrition research supports MOS for its role in immune-related outcomes and overall gut wall support.',
   sell:'Inulin + FOS + MOS = a triple-action prebiotic approach. MOS specifically helps the immune system respond better to challenges in the gut.'},

  {id:'i11',icon:'🍇',name:'Pomegranate',cat:'fruit',catLabel:'Superfood Antioxidant',

   conditions:['joint'],
   what:'A naturally occurring compound essential for cartilage production and maintenance. Often derived from shellfish or chicken cartilage in Farmina.',

   conditions:['joint'],
   what:'Works alongside glucosamine to maintain joint health. Found naturally in cartilage and connective tissue.',
   why:'Chondroitin draws fluid into cartilage (keeping it cushioned) and inhibits enzymes that break down cartilage. The glucosamine+chondroitin combination is more effective than either alone.',
   sell:'"Glucosamine AND chondroitin" is the gold standard in joint supplements. Farmina includes both in every adult formula.'},

  {id:'i17',icon:'🌼',name:'Marigold Extract (Lutein)',cat:'botanical',catLabel:'Eye Health',

   conditions:['digestion'],
   what:'An ancient wheat variety used at 10% in the Low Ancestral Grain range. Organically certified — no pesticides or GMOs.',
   why:'Spelt has a different gluten structure to modern wheat, making it more digestible for many dogs. Rich in B vitamins, magnesium and zinc. Ancient grains were part of the original "ancestral" canine diet.',
   sell:'Not all grains are equal. Organic spelt is nothing like processed corn or wheat derivatives. It\'s a clean, traceable, ancient carbohydrate.'},

  {id:'i19',icon:'🌾',name:'Organic Oats',cat:'grain',catLabel:'Ancient Grain (LAG Range)',
   conditions:['digestion','immune'],
   what:'Whole organic oats at 10% in the Low Ancestral Grain range. Naturally gluten-free in their pure form.',
